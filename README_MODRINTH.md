## ⚙️ Configuration (MidnightConfig)

<details>
<summary>⚙️ Click to expand configuration options</summary>

Cobblemon Cards is fully configurable out of the box via **MidnightConfig**. You can access the configuration menu in-game (requires *ModMenu*) or by editing the `config/cobblemon-cards.json` file.

| Config Option | Default Value | Range / Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `globalStatMultiplier` | `10.0` | `0.0` - `100.0` | Multiplier applied to all passive RPG statistics bonuses granted by slotted cards. |
| `enableStatCaps` | `true` | `Boolean` | Caps how high each player stat can be pushed by a binder. Without it, stats stack linearly with every card slotted. |
| `armorStatCap` | `10.0` | `0.0` - `10000.0` | Maximum Armor bonus from a binder (flat). Companion options exist for every player stat: `miningSpeedStatCap` (`15.0`), `movementSpeedStatCap` (`50.0`), `attackDamageStatCap` (`50.0`), `attackSpeedStatCap` (`50.0`), `luckStatCap` (`10.0`), `maxHealthStatCap` (`20.0`), `cardDropChanceStatCap` (`50.0`). |
| `doesMasterBinderProvideStats` | `false` | `Boolean` | Whether the Master Album grants passive stats. Off by default: it holds 12,000 cards, so its stat sum would dwarf every other binder tier. It remains fully usable as storage. |
| `maxSpawnBoostMultiplier` | `5.0` | `0.0` - `10000.0` | Ceiling on the spawn weight multiplier a binder grants to an elemental type. `5.0` means a boosted type is at most 5x more likely to spawn. The spawn-side counterpart of the stat caps above. |
| `recyclerProcessTime` | `40` | `1` - `1200` | Time (in ticks) it takes for a Card Recycler to process one card. |
| `gradingStationProcessTime` | `100` | `1` - `12000` | Time (in ticks) it takes for a Grading Station to grade a card. |
| `gradingStationDustCost` | `5` | `0` - `64` | Amount of Cobblecard Dust required to grade a card. |
| `godPackTicketChance` | `1.0` | `0.0` - `100.0` | Percentage chance of obtaining a God Pack Ticket when opening a Booster Pack. |
| `cardDropChance` | `1.0` | `0.0` - `100.0` | Percentage chance for a defeated or captured Pokémon to drop a card. |
| `enableBoosterChestSpawn` | `true` | `Boolean` | Whether classic booster packs should spawn in Minecraft structure chests. |
| `boosterChestSpawnChance` | `2.0` | `0.0` - `100.0` | Percentage chance to find a classic booster pack inside a structure chest. |

## 📦 Modpack Integration & Standalone Notice

> [!NOTE]
> **Designed for Modpacks:** Cobblemon Cards is primarily designed and balanced to be played as part of a larger modpack. While everything has been built to ensure it works perfectly as a standalone mod (acting as a complete addon to Cobblemon), the gameplay loop, drop rates, and RPG stat rewards shine best when integrated alongside other mods, quests, and custom progression systems.
